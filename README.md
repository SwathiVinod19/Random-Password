# Random-Password
As a part of the UoT Bootcamp we were asked to write the javascript code to a random password generator. The html code was provided and I had to code the javascript.

## Features 
"*" Everytime the user presses the "Generate Password" red button, the user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
"*" The user can choose the length of the password (between a range of 8-128 characters). If he/she chooses below 8 or above 128, an "Invalid Input!" message will pop up.
"*" The user can choose the type od characters he/she would like in their new password
"*" The user should select atleast one character type for a password to be generated
"*" When all prompts are answered , a random password is generated

#### Acknowledgement
This activity was challenging for me. I spent hours on understanding basic javascript.. in addition to two tutoring sessions to come up with a solution (with their guidance and support). I would also like to thank my peer group for helping me along the way.
